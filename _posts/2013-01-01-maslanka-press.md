	WooCommerce site for a sheet music ordering service
</p>

This site used a 100% custom WordPress/WooCommerce theme created by myself, with a lot of custom functionality. Unfortunately it's not currently online.

<div class="gallery">
	{% include figure.html img="maslanka-press/2.jpg" caption="Product listing page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="maslanka-press/3.jpg" caption="Product page (top)" %}
	{% include figure.html img="maslanka-press/5.jpg" caption="Product page (bottom)" %}
	{% include figure.html img="maslanka-press/4.jpg" caption="Product customization page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="maslanka-press/6.jpg" caption="My Account page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="maslanka-press/7.jpg" caption="Order form for retailers" %}
</div>
