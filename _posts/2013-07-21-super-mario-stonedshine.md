	I have no excuse for this but at least it's funny

This was just a weird drawing I decided to do a few years ago, originally posted to DeviantArt. That said, it's been stolen so many times that I figured I should post it here.

Style-wise, this image is a replica of the official style Nintendo typically uses for 2D Mario art. Matching styles is always a fun challenge. The result is an inappropriate drawing which looks like official art. Discomfort achieved!
