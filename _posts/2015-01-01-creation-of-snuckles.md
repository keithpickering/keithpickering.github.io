	Snuckles is love, Snuckles is life.
</p>

Years ago my friends and I had a satirical(?) live podcast dedicated to our ironic Sonic fan character, Snuckles. It was as amazing as it was terrible. The general idea was to make fun of the internet's surplus of ridiculous Sonic OCs by creating our own character with unlimited strengths, no weaknesses, and a convoluted/contradictory backstory.

Snuckles is seen here next to Ded Murio, which was another character we made in an attempt to parody badly-written creepypastas.
