	Snuckles is love, Snuckles is life.
</p>

Years ago my friends and I had a satirical(?) live podcast dedicated to our ironic Sonic fan character, Snuckles. It was as amazing as it was terrible. The general idea was to make fun of the internet's surplus of ridiculous Sonic OCs by creating our own character with unlimited strengths, no weaknesses, and a convoluted/contradictory backstory.

Snuckles is seen here next to <em>Ded Murio</em>, which was another character we made in an attempt to parody badly-written creepypasta stories. Obviously the image as a whole is a parody of the Creation of Adam. I would've liked to include more characters but we didn't really make many others. Maybe in a future rendition the <em>Naughty Pirate</em> can make an appearance.
