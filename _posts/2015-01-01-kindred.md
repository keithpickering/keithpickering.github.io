	Like a more wholesome version of Tindr
</p>

This was a mobile app demo created with the Ionic framework, which uses AngularJS. The app itself is supposed to be a dating app which matches users based on their chosen religion. Not really my thing but it was fun to make.

<div class="gallery">
	{% include figure.html img="kindred/2.jpg" caption="Select religion page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="kindred/3.jpg" caption="Main matching screen" %}
	{% include figure.html img="kindred/4.jpg" caption="Settings page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="kindred/5.jpg" caption="Main menu" %}
</div>

Tools Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS
