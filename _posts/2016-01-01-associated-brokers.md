<p class="post--full__excerpt">
	WordPress site for a local real estate company
</p>

This site uses a 100% custom WordPress theme designed and built by myself. Quick and responsive, it has led to a notable increase in online sales compared to the company's old site.

<div class="gallery">
	{% include figure.html img="associated-brokers/2.jpg" caption="Homepage (below hero area)" %}
	{% include figure.html img="associated-brokers/3.jpg" caption="Services page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="associated-brokers/4.jpg" caption="Contact form page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="associated-brokers/5.jpg" caption="FAQs page" %}
</div>
