<p class="post--full__excerpt">
	When message boards and RPGs collide
</p>

Minus World is an interactive RPG and fighting game combined with a message board. It celebrates early-2000s internet culture in an ironic, deadpan way that only our community is capable of.

I am the lead developer on this project, and I've had to extensively modify the MyBB software (written in PHP) to get our list of features working, including but not limited to a complete inventory system, equippable items for avatars, and a Spellbook full of effects you can cast on others' posts using EX points collected through various forum actions.

Along with my work on the backend of the site, I'm also responsible for the majority of the custom frontend code, as well as many of the visual elements such as the logo, Spell portraits, etc.

<div class="gallery">
	{% include figure.html img="minus-world/2.jpg" caption="Inventory page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="minus-world/3.jpg" caption="Gear customization page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="minus-world/5.jpg" caption="Spellbook" %}
	{% include figure.html img="minus-world/4.jpg" caption="Spellbook (on your own post)" %}
</div>
