<p class="post--full__excerpt">
	When message boards and RPGs collide
</p>

I'll spare you the details of what led to Minus World's creation, but basically it's a celebration of early-2000s message board culture combined with a fighting game/RPG. That probably doesn't make any sense but oh well.

As the lead developer and project manager of sorts, I had to heavily modify the MyBB software (written in PHP) as well as create several custom plugins to get a lot of our required features working. I am also responsible for customizing the default theme, creating the general look and feel of the site, and I contributed several design elements (Spell images, equippable Gear items, and so on).

<div class="gallery">
	{% include figure.html img="minus-world/2.jpg" caption="Inventory page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="minus-world/3.jpg" caption="Gear customization page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="minus-world/5.jpg" caption="Spellbook" %}
	{% include figure.html img="minus-world/4.jpg" caption="Spellbook (on your own post)" %}
</div>

Tools Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MyBB
