<p class="post--full__excerpt">
	Simple responsive website for a company managing commercial properties in Wisconsin
</p>

This ASP.NET site was originally table-based, non-responsive, and it hadn't been updated in several years. I was tasked with creating an all-new, responsive, mobile-first theme for the existing content. This required a total upheaval of the site's template files, replacing all the old table code with clean, semantic HTML.

<div class="gallery">
	{% include figure.html img="mullins-group/2.jpg" caption="Rental listing page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="mullins-group/3.jpg" caption="View property page" %}
	{% include figure.html img="mullins-group/4.jpg" caption="Homepage (mobile view)" %}
	{% include figure.html img="mullins-group/5.jpg" caption="Main menu (mobile view)" %}
</div>
